# TL;DR.

This post provides a detailed guide on installing and setting up Pythagora and GPT Pilot, two powerful tools for app development using large language models like GPT-4. The prerequisites include using a Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu) and building virtual environments with Miniconda and venv. I start with creating a Miniconda environment, setting up a Pythagora home directory, installing Pythagora through VS Code, and configuring GPT Pilot for use with Pythagora. I concludes with listing the potential benefits of using these tools for efficient app development.

# An Introduction.

Pythagora (along with Devin) is the newest attempt to integrate large language models (LLMs) into the app development process.

> The purpose of this post is to show how to fuse a local LLM with Pythagora and GPT Pilot.

# The Big Picture.

Pythagora and Devin could be very handy when building the 12 Startups. Devin has not been released at the time of writing, but Pythagora looks extremely promising. (I'm usually an optimist, regardless of how many times I've been burned.)

# Prerequisites.

* A Debian-based Linux distro (I use Ubuntu),
    
* [Miniconda](https://solodev.app/installing-miniconda).
    

# Updating my Base System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```python
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

# What is Anaconda and Miniconda?

Python projects can run in virtual environments. These isolated spaces are used to manage project dependencies. Different versions of the same package can run in different environments while avoiding version conflicts.

venv is a built-in Python 3.3+ module that runs virtual environments. Anaconda is a Python and R distribution for scientific computing that includes the `conda` package manager. Miniconda is a small, free, bootstrap version of Anaconda that also includes the `conda` package manager, Python, and other packages that are required or useful (like pip and zlib).

[https://solodev.app/installing-miniconda](https://solodev.app/installing-miniconda).

I ensure [Miniconda is installed](https://solodev.app/installing-miniconda) (`conda -V`) before continuing with this post.

## Creating a Miniconda Environment.

* I use the `conda` command to display a `list` of Miniconda `env`ironments:
    

```bash
conda env list
```

* I use `conda` to `create`, and `activate`, a new environment named (-n) (Pythagora):
    

```bash
conda create -n Pythagora python=3.11 -y && conda activate Pythagora
```

> NOTE: This command creates the (Pythagora) environment, then activates the (Pythagora) environment.

## Creating the Pythagora Home Directory.

> NOTE: I will now define the home directory in the environment directory.

* I create the Pythagora home directory:
    

```bash
mkdir ~/Pythagora
```

* I make new directories within the (Pythagora) environment:
    

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3/envs/Pythagora/etc/conda/activate.d
```

* I use the Nano text editor to create the `set_working_directory.sh` shell script:
    

```bash
sudo nano ~/miniconda3/envs/Pythagora/etc/conda/activate.d/set_working_directory.sh
```

* I copy the following, paste (CTRL + SHIFT + V) it to the `set_working_directory.sh` script, save (CTRL + S) the changes, and exit (CTRL + X) Nano:
    

```bash
cd ~/Pythagora
```

* I activate the (base) environment:
    

```bash
conda activate
```

* I activate the (Pythagora) environment:
    

```bash
conda activate Pythagora
```

> NOTE: I should now, by default, be in the `~/Pythagora` home directory.

# What is Pythagora?

Pythagora is a tool that helps create apps from the ground up using large language models. It's an extension for VS Code and runs on GPT Pilot, one of the best code generators around. While designed around GPT-4, I have adjusted the GPT Pilot settings so Pythagora can work with local LLMs (large language models).

## Installing Pythagora.

* I open VS Code.
    
* I open the Extensions panel.
    
* I search for "Pythagora".
    
* I click on the blue "Install" button for "Pythagora (GPT Pilot) Beta" from Pythagora Technologies.
    
* I select the installation directory for GPT Pilot, i.e. `~/Pythagora`.
    
* I apply for an account, if required.
    
* I click the purple "Create New App" button:

> NOTE: The rest of this post involves fixing this RuntimeError.

* I exit VS Code.
    

# What is GPT Pilot?

GPT Pilot is the main engine that powers the Pythagora VS Code extension. (The developers of Pythagora want it to be the first, *true* AI assistant for developers.) Together, GPT Pilot and Pythagora do more than just fill in missing code or help with pull request messages. GPT Pilot helps Pythagora act like a real AI developer that can write complete features, fix bugs, discuss problems, request reviews, and do many other tasks related to coding.

## Installing GPT Pilot.

* From the (Pythagora) terminal, I update the Ollama utility:
    

```plaintext
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

* I use the Nano text editor to open the `.env` file:
    

```plaintext
sudo nano ~/Pythagora/gpt-pilot/pilot/.env
```

* I make the following changes, save (CTRL + S) the changes, and exit (CTRL + X) Nano:
    

```plaintext
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions
OPENAI_API_KEY=1111

MODEL_NAME=codellama
```

> NOTE: I ensure Ollama has local access to CodeLlama, e.g. `ollama pull codellama`.

## Settings for Pythagora.

* I change to the `gpt-pilot` directory:
    

```plaintext
cd ~/Pythagora/gpt-pilot
```

* I install venv:
    

```plaintext
sudo apt install python3.11-venv
```

* I create a new venv (virtual environment):
    

```plaintext
python -m venv --without-pip ~/Pythagora/gpt-pilot/pilot-env
```

* I activate the venv:
    

```plaintext
source ~/Pythagora/gpt-pilot/pilot-env/bin/activate
```

* From the (pilot-env) environment, I install pip:
    

```plaintext
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
```

* I check pip:
    

```plaintext
which pip
```

* I upgrade pip:
    

```plaintext
pip install --upgrade pip
```

* I install the requirements:
    

```plaintext
pip install -r ~/Pythagora/gpt-pilot/requirements.txt
```

* I deactivate (pilot-env) environment:
    

```plaintext
deactivate
```

* I activate the (base) environment:
    

```plaintext
conda activate
```

## Testing VS Code.

* I open VS Code.
