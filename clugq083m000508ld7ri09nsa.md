# TL;DR.

Installing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is a step-by-step process. It includes making a bootable USB thumb drive on Windows 11, installing and securing Ubuntu, setting up Ubuntu Studio, and imaging my system with CloneZilla. This post also covers installing different package managers, browsers, various software, and LLM utilities. The Ubuntu 24.04 LTS distro offers a stable system and a predictable computing environment.

Fortunately, I also have images of my previous system if anything should go wrong.

# An Introduction.

In 2015, I started using CentOS 7 which was my first Linux-based daily driver. When it was released in 2016, I switched to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Since then, I have upgraded my LTS distro every 2 years, like clockwork. It is time again to upgrade my systems:

> The purpose of this post is to define the installation process for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, while also including many of the development tools I use, and all of the system utilities I need.

# The Big Picture.

I will install the new Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (long term service) distribution on every system in my home. These systems include:

* My Workstation PC (which is a dual-boot system),
    
* My Homelab NUC (which sits next to my Workstation),
    
* My Bedroom NUC (for streaming content from my NAS), and
    
* My Lounge Laptop (for streaming content when I'm not in bed).
    

My NAS has its own proprietary OS.

# Prerequisites.

* A NEW Linux-based distribution called [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)***↗.***
    
* Deregistering any important apps, e.g. DaVinci Resolve Studio.
    

# Making a Bootable USB Installer.

* In Windows, I plug in a spare 8GB USB thumb drive.
    

> NOTE: I find quality 8GB thumb drives are cheaper than 4GB thumb drives. This makes sense to me. Making a tape-out of an 8GB die costs the same as a 4GB tape-out. Cooking the wafers costs the same, too. Finally, it's cheaper NOT to re-tool for 4GB chips and just make 8GB chips instead. So, my guess is there's no cost-effective reason for making 4GB thumb drives. As a result, I believe scarcity is the main factor that is driving up the prices of 4GB thumb drives.

* I download the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ISO file:
    

[https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

* I download, and install, an ISO-to-USB utility like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
    
* I use the ISO-to-USB utility to install the Ubuntu 24.04 ISO file onto the 8GB USB thumb drive as a bootable image.
    

# Installing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

> NOTE: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is installed on a 1TB M.2 SSD (solid-state drive) within my system. The boot loader is installed on the nvmeOn1p1 (500MB) partition, and the system files are installed on the nvmeOn1p2 (999.5GB) partition.

* I plug the bootable Ubuntu 24.04 LTS USB thumb drive into my system.
    
* I (re)start my system.
    
* During POST (power-on self test), I boot into my UEFI BIOS (unified extensible firmware interface basic input output system) by tapping the F2 key.
    
* Within the UEFI BIOS, I set the bootable USB thumb drive as the first boot device.
    
* I (re)start the UEFI BIOS POST sequence.
    
* After booting into the USB thumb drive, I begin installing the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS distribution.
    

## During the Installation Process.

My Workstation is a Windows/Ubuntu dual-boot system. The rest of my home-based PCs run Ubuntu only. Therefore, only my Workstation requires a carefully crafted installation process, i.e. installing Ubuntu without destroying Windows. If things go wrong then I'd have to re-install Windows as well. Upgrading Ubuntu on a dual-boot system is a painful process.

> NOTE: I may need to use the 'Grubfix' utility, that I keep on a separate USB thumb drive, if I can't choose Ubuntu or Windows when booting into my Workstation.

## OPTIONAL: Fix for the Terminal Input Delay.

* I add a new repo to my system:
    

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vanvugt/mutter
```

* I update my local repo list:
    

```bash
sudo apt update
```

* I upgrade my system:
    

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

* I reboot my system:
    

```bash
reboot # Or use 'sudo reboot'
```

## Changing Some System Settings.

* I open the `Settings` menu (⚙) from the `System` menu (top-right of the screen) or the `Show Apps` menu (𐄡).
    
* I change to `Dark` mode at `Settings > Appearance > Style`, if required.
    

---

* I change the `Position of New Icons` to `Top Left` at `Settings > Ubuntu Desktop > Desktop Icons > Position of New Icons`, if required.
    
* I change the `Position on screen` of the Dock to `Bottom` at `Settings > Ubuntu Desktop > Dock > Position on screen`, if required.
    
* I deactivate the `Show Volumes and Devices` option for the Dock at `Settings > Ubuntu Desktop > Dock > Configure dock behaviour > Show Volumes and Devices`, if required.
    

---

* I change the monitor layout at `Settings > Screen Display`, if required.
    

---

* I reduce the animation in the UI at `Settings > Accessibility > Seeing > Reduce Animation`.
    
* I change the size of all text in the UI at `Settings > Accessibility > Seeing > Large Text`.
    
* I change the cursor size in the UI at `Settings > Accessibility > Cursor Size`.
    
* I turn off the blinking cursor in the terminal at `Settings > Accessibility > Typing > Cursor Blinking`.
    
* I update my system:
    

```plaintext
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

## Securing the New Installation.

Throughout the rest of this post, I will be creating way-point images as recovery mechanisms, although nothing EVER goes wrong. I suggest saving (or writing down) the names of these images in a file (or on a piece of paper) and crossing these names off the list as each image is created. All the image names are highlighted in yellow throughout the rest of this post.

## Using CloneZilla.

* I plug the CloneZilla USB thumb drive into my system.
    
* I (re)start my system.
    
* During POST (power-on self test), I boot into my UEFI BIOS (unified extensible firmware interface basic input output system) by continually tapping the F2 key as the POST runs.
    
* Within the UEFI BIOS, I set the bootable USB thumb drive as the first boot device.
    
* I (re)start the UEFI BIOS POST sequence.
    
* After booting into the USB thumb drive, I use CloneZilla to create an image of each stage of my installation process. Just in case. Although nothing EVER goes wrong. Right?
    
* I use CloneZilla to create an image of the distribution called <mark>[date]-img-work-ubuntu</mark>.
    

> NOTE: The `[date]-img` is automatically generated by CloneZilla, `work` refers to the Workstation, and `ubuntu` is a reference to the contents of the image file. For instance, another system might use a name like `[date]-img-bed-porn` (which stands for `packaging opinions regarding nachos`, of course).

* The last option in my imaging sequence is to power off the system after the image is created.
    

# Connecting my NAS.

> NOTE: This section of my post is unique to my systems and can be safely ignored. If you have a NAS (network attached server) then you probably already have a plan for connecting it/them to your system(s).

* I power up my Workstation.
    
* In the file manager, I navigate into the `img-work` drive.
    
* I open the `img-work` drive in a terminal (`Right-click > Open in Terminal` from the pop-up menu).
    
* From the terminal, I change the owner of the `Ubuntu` image:
    

```plaintext
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER [date]-img-work-ubuntu
```

---

> NOTE: I need to access my NAS early on in this post because of the high number of CloneZilla images I generate. I will occasionally need to off-load these images from the 2GB external HDD to the NAS so I can continue using CloneZilla.

* I install the CIFS utilities:
    

```plaintext
sudo apt install -y cifs-utils smbclient
```

> NOTE: CIFS is a dialect of SMB.

* I remove these directories:
    

```bash
sudo rm -r ~/Desktop ~/Documents ~/Downloads \
~/Music ~/Pictures ~/Public ~/Templates ~/Videos
```

> NOTE: It is now VITAL to continue this section of the post until the very end as these directories, which no longer exist, are vital to running this distro.

* I make a hidden file called `.cred_smb` in my home directory:
    

```bash
sudo touch /home/yt/.cred_smb
```

* I open the `.cred_smb` file using the Nano text editor:
    

```bash
sudo nano /home/yt/.cred_smb
```

* I copy the following, add it (CTRL + SHIFT + V) to the `.cred_smb` file, save (CTRL + S) the changes, and exit (CTRL + X) Nano:
    

```plaintext
username=yt
password=super-secret-password
domain=WORKGROUP
```

* I change the access permissions for the `.cred_smb` file:
    

```bash
sudo chmod 600 ~/.cred_smb
```

* I make a copy the `fstab` file as `fstab.bak`:
    

```plaintext
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
```

* I use the Nano text editor to open the `fstab` file:
    

```plaintext
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

* I copy the following, add it (CTRL + SHIFT + V) to the bottom of the `fstab` file, save (CTRL + S) the changes, and exit (CTRL + X) Nano:

* I create these directories where the remote shares will mount:
    

```plaintext
sudo mkdir /media/yt/AI && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Desktop && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Documents && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Downloads && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Drawings && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Images && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Media && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Music && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/MyDocs && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/MyDrive && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Pictures && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Public && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Screencasts && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Screenshots && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Templates && \
sudo mkdir /media/yt/Videos
```

* I create these symlinks (symbolic links) where the remote shares will display:
    

```plaintext
ln -s "/media/yt/AI" "/home/yt/AI"  && \
ln -s "/media/yt/Desktop" "/home/yt/Desktop" && \
ln -s "/media/yt/MyDocs" "/home/yt/Documents" && \
ln -s "/media/yt/Downloads" "/home/yt/Downloads" && \
ln -s "/media/yt/Drawings" "/home/yt/Drawings" && \

ln -s "/media/yt/Screenshots" "/home/yt/Screenshots" && \
ln -s "/media/yt/Templates" "/home/yt/Templates" && \
ln -s "/media/yt/Videos" "/home/yt/Videos"
```

> NOTE: Some of these symlinks will replace system directories, e.g. the Downloads directory.

* I reboot my system to check the NAS symlinks.
    

> NOTE: Within a terminal, my prompt tells me I'm in the `/media/yt/whatever` directory. This makes sense given the symlinks I just created.

* I update my system:
    

```bash
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

* I list my output audio devices again, to confirm the change:
    

```bash
pactl list short sinks
```

> ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1714383439393/27ac9050-92b8-4e18-b671-74a7c3705b0f.png align="center")

* I open the default Pulse Audio file with the Nano text editor:
    

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pulse/default.pa
```

* I scroll to the end of the file (CTRL + END), comment out the existing `set-default-sink` setting with a hash (#), replace it with the following, save (CTRL + S) the changes, and exit (CTRL + X) Nano:

## Plan A: Install DaVinci Resolve Studio 18 Directly.

If the direct install fails, I can [switch to Plan B](https://solodev.app/preparing-for-ubuntu-2404-lts#heading-plan-a-install-davinci-resolve-studio-18-directly).

* I change to the Downloads directory:
    

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

* I install these libraries:
    

```bash
sudo apt install -y libfuse2 libapr1 libaprutil1 libglu1-mesa \
libnuma1 libxcb-composite0 libxcb-cursor0 libxcb-damage0 \
libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-render-util0 \
libxcb-util1 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xinput0 libxcb-xkb1 \
libxkbcommon-x11-0 ocl-icd-libopencl1 libasound2 libxcb-shape0 libxtst6
```

* I go to the [DaVinci Resolve Studio 18 downloads page](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/event/davinciresolvedownload) and download the installer:
    
* I unpack the DaVinci Resolve Studio 18 zip file:
    

```bash
unzip ./DaVinci_Resolve_18.6.5_Linux.zip
```

> NOTE: At the time of writing, 18.6.5 is the latest version.

* I change into the unzipped directory:
    

```bash
cd ./DaVinci_Resolve_18.6.5_Linux
```

* I list the contents of the directory:
    

```bash
ls
```

* I change the permission of the DaVinci\_Resolve\_Studio\_18.6.5\_Linux.run file to an executable:
    

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./DaVinci_Resolve_Studio_18.6.5_Linux.run
```

* I install the DaVinci\_Resolve\_Studio\_18.6.5\_Linux.run file:
    

```bash
sudo ./DaVinci_Resolve_Studio_18.6.5_Linux.run -i
```

* This is the displayed output after the installation:
    

```bash
Using a pre-existing Data dir : /var/BlackmagicDesign/DaVinci Resolve
DaVinci Resolve installed to /opt/resolve
```

## Plan B: Install DaVinci Resolve Studio 18 within Distrobox.

* I can [install DaVinci Resolve Studio 18 within Distrobox](https://solodev.app/using-distrobox-on-ubuntu-to-run-davinci-resolve-on-ubuntu-not-a-typo).
    
* I update my system:
    

```bash
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

* I reboot my system with the CloneZilla USB thumb drive installed.
    
* I use CloneZilla to create an image of the distribution called <mark>[date]-img-work-davinci</mark>.
    

# Saving the Final Image.

* I power up my Workstation.
    
* In the file manager, I navigate into the `img-work` drive.
    
* I open the `img-work` drive in a terminal (`Right-click > Open in Terminal` from the pop-up menu).
    
* From a terminal, I change the owner of the `DaVinci` image:
    

```plaintext
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER [date]-img-work-davinci
```

* I reboot my system with the CloneZilla USB thumb drive installed.
    
* I use CloneZilla to create an image of the distribution called <mark>[date]-img-work-fullsys</mark>.
    

# The Results.

Transitioning to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS promises to be a tiresome journey, filled with the promise of new features yet still ending up with the same ol' stable distribution. This guide has walked through the installation process, from preparing a bootable USB on a Widows 11 system to securing the APT package manager, and even connecting to a NAS. I've also covered the installation of various package managers, browsers, and essential software like Ubuntu Studio, ensuring I'm well-equipped for work. I've tackled system updates, app installs, and even the integration of LLM utilities, demonstrating the versatility of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS for app development. By creating system images at each significant step, I've ensured a safety net exists that makes for a time-consuming, yet stress-free process.

As I look forward to the official release, it's clear that Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is set to underwhelm my computing expectations, reaffirming Ubuntu's commitment to providing a bland, though user-friendly operating system. Whether for professional development, creative endeavours, or everyday use, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is poised to become another mediocre upgrade for enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Safe. Boring. Predictable. Stable. Exactly what a developer needs in her systems.

# In Conclusion.

I'm looking forward to the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS launch! It's coming out on April 25, 2024, and I plan to update all of my home devices to this new version. This includes my Workstation PC, my Homelab NUC, the bedroom NUC, and the living room laptop.

I've been practising my installation process with Ubuntu 23.10, also known as "Mantic Minotaur," to ensure I'm ready for the launch. Even though it's only supported until July 2024, it's a great way to prepare for the big update. (I also needed content for this blog.)

Why choose Ubuntu 24.04 LTS? It has stability, security, and many features that will improve my computing experience. My current, yet continually evolving, process involves making a bootable USB on Windows 11, securing the APT package manager, and setting up Ubuntu Studio for my creative work. Plus, I made sure to back up all my systems with CloneZilla images at every step. Because, honestly, nothing ever goes wrong... right?

I've also installed LLM utilities, from LXD/LXC to AutoGen Studio, so I can make sure I'm ready for work. As the release gets closer, I feel excited and inspired. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS will be a stable and predictable upgrade, great for developers like me who prefer reliability over extra features.

What about you? Are you planning to upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, or will you be watching from the sidelines? Let's discuss in the comments below!

Until next time: Be safe, be kind, be awesome.
