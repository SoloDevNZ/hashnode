This is my first post. Actually, it's a technology test but I have to start somewhere. In my experience, "somewhere" is hardly ever "over the rainbow", and my dog's question of "Where's my ball?" is typically answered with "Somewhere over the neighbours fence."

## Beyond Boring.

Technology tests are boring. "Hello, world" is a yawn-fest. And "ToDo apps" are mind-numbingly tedious. So, I'm going to do something different. Well, different for me, anyway. I'm going to document my Nuxt adventure.

Wait, that sounds beyond boring, too. I guess there's no pleasing some people.
