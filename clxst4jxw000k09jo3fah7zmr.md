# TL;DR.

This post lists current and pending domain names associated with various projects under development. It covers the importance of domain names, how they work, and provides a detailed table of domains, their descriptions, and key features. The domains span multiple categories, including media, technology, business, and AI-driven applications, showcasing a diverse range of capabilities in app and website development.

# An Introduction.

The following is a list of current, and pending, domain names:

> The purpose of this post is to list the projects the are under current development.

# The Big Picture.

A domain name is my first step in creating an app or website. There are a number of reasons for these apps, including:

* Defining various, internal business units,
    
* Building income generating business units,
    
* Producing business units that can be sold to other companies, and
    
* Showcasing the range of apps and websites that I am able to produce.

# What is a Domain Name?

The Internet uses an octet (8-bit) numbering system to identify the locations of the numerous, online resources. These locations are called IPs, or Internet Protocol v4 addresses. (IP v6 addresses are also available, but they are rarely used.) Trying to remember 4 sets of numbers is tiresome so, in the early 1970s, domain names were introduced. When I type a domain name into the address bar of a browser, that name resolves to a specific IP address thanks to the Domain Name System, or DNS. DNS is the phone book of the Internet and uses a distributed service that resolves domain names to IP addresses. (New domains can take up to 48-hours to resolve.) Now that the browser knows the IP address, it can start interacting with the services at that given location. The computer at that specific IP address may be hosting any number of services, including (but not limited to):

* Web servers,
    
* Email servers,
    
* Gaming servers, and
    
* FTP (File Transfer Protocol) servers.
    

Every device gets an IP address when it connects to the Internet. These dynamic IP addresses are pooled by each Internet Service Provider, or ISP. When a device disconnects from the Internet, the IP address is released and returned to the ISP pool. Companies (and people) that use domain names typically rent space on someone else's servers. They go to their domain name provider, point the domain name(s) to the DNS (Domain Name System) run by the host, activates some settings on the hosting service, and the domain name *eventually* points to the provided service (web hosting, email server, etc.) Less frequently, people like me rent static IPs from our ISPs, pass our domain name(s) through Cloudflare, use Cloudflare to resolve our domain names to our static IP addresses, and host our own services (web servers, email servers, etc.) on our own on-prem servers. (In my case, I use an Intel NUC v10.)

# In Conclusion.

Thanks for exploring the future of my domain-named projects for 2024 and 2025.

In this post, I dove deep into the world of domain names and their pivotal role in app and website development. From defining internal business units to building income-generating projects, domain names are the first crucial step in creating my digital presence. But what exactly are domain names, and why are they important?

A domain name is more than just an address; it's a gateway to various online services like web servers, email servers, and more. Thanks to the Domain Name System (DNS), these names resolve to specific IP addresses, making it easier for users to navigate the web.

Here's a sneak peek at some of the exciting domains that are under development:

* Monty.co.nz - A smart phone camera app,
    
* [SoloDev.app](https://SoloDev.app) - A tech blog for developers,
    
* AuditorLog.com - An onboarding app for apprentices,
    
* TechLearnAI.com - A learning management system powered by AI,
    
* TechNewsAI.com - An AI-driven technology news publishing app, and
    
* CompanyLite.com - A business management app.
    

And I have other exciting endeavours on the horizon!!

Each domain represents a unique project that showcases a diverse range of capabilities, from media and technology, to business and AI-driven applications.

Curious to know more about these projects and how they might transform the digital landscape? I know *I'm* excited to start building these entities!!

What do you think is the most exciting domain-named project for 2024 and 2025? Let me know in the comments!

Until next time: Be safe, be kind, be awesome.
