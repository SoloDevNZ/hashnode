## TL;DR.

**Last Update:** <mark>5th September 2023</mark>

I've accepted the "12 Startups in 12 Months" challenge. I plan to deploy 21 utilities, and a dog blog, by the end of April 2024. I accepted this challenge for purposes of personal growth and business success. No pressure, then.

## An Introduction.

I saw [Andrés Arias](https://hashnode.com/@dresnite) post about accepting the "[12 Startups in 12 Months](https://dresnite.com/im-launching-12-startups-in-12-months-in-2023)" challenge [that originated way back in 2014](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/).

This idea just BLEW MY MIND!! I tossed Andrés a quick message while wiping brain matter off my monitor. I told him that I loved the idea and I'm going to do it, too. Yes, I'm hitching my wagon to his rising star!!

> The purpose of this post is to present my list of (more than) 12 Startups that I will build by May 2024.

## My Startups List.

My startups are business utilities and lifestyle utilities. It will be challenging to build multiple startups, considering my list is made up of *at least* 12 Startups. Anyway, here are my Startups, in alphabetical order, starting with (a Startup that isn't alphabetically listed)...

Most of my startups are business utilities. It seems appropriate to build startup tools that may help with managing my startup. Sure, there are lots of business management apps out there, but none of those are custom to my requirements.

## Beyond 12S.

As each project is completed, I will deploy others from the following list:

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Steam-Powered Tesla Turbines (A Rotorua-based 12S for battery chemistry field testing)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>A Training Platform (An interactive 12S education system for distance learning)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## The Results.

Embarking on an ambitious "12 Startups in 12 Months" challenge offers an exciting opportunity to develop a diverse range of business and lifestyle utilities. While it may be a demanding journey, the experience gained and the potential for success makes this enterprise a worthwhile endeavour.

## In Conclusion.

This challenge is, technically, "<mark>17 Startups, and a Dog Blog, in 12 Months</mark>." The point is: If I get the foundations right, I can make lots of apps each year.

My brain is buzzing with processes, protocols, and procedures. This is going to be an EPIC AMOUNT OF FUN!! (...And work.) Yay, me.

I'm excited, and I can't wait to bash out my next post.

Until next time: Be safe, be kind, be awesome.
