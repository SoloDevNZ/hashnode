## Taking a Break.

I'm taking a break. No, I'm not going on vacation because I already did that in August. Instead, I'm working through the holidays but won't be publishing. I'll be working on the schedule for:

* Building a Coding Swarm with Local Embeddings in January 2024,
    
* Using the Coding Swarm to build the 12 Startups in February 2024,
    
* Preparing the 12 Startups for testers by the end of March 2024, and
    
* Preparing the Digital Core (NZ) Limited Business Plan in April 2024.
    

Q1 of 2024 is going to be busy, and this is also when Modular will release the [MAX platform](https://www.modular.com/max) for the [Mojo programming language](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo).

The last 4 months were insane.

The next 4 months will be deranged.

And I'll push my mental health to its limits.

Merry Holidays and a Happy New Start to 2024.

Until next year: Be safe, be kind, be awesome.
