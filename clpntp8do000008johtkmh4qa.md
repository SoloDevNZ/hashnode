# TL;DR.

Distrobox is a container system. The main advantages of using Distrobox include:

* The isolation of container libraries,
    
* Easy access to the host hardware, and
    
* Easy access to the host file system.
    

# Prerequisites.

* A Linux-based distro (I use Ubuntu), and
    
* [A Docker installation](https://solodev.app/installing-docker).
    

# An Introduction.

\[pending\]

# The Big Picture.

\[pending\]

# Updating my System.

* From the (base) terminal, I update my (base) system:
    

```bash
sudo apt clean && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && \
sudo apt --fix-broken install && \
sudo apt autoclean && \
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

# What is Distrobox?

Distrobox is a tool that allows me to run any Linux distribution within my terminal. It enables both backward and forward compatibility with any software, and the freedom to use whichever distribution I'm most comfortable with. Distrobox uses Podman, Docker, or Lilipod to create containers using the Linux distribution of my choosing. It aims to run any software, on top of my host system, without any hassle.

## Installing Distrobox.

* I use the `Curl` command to download, and run, the Distrobox installation script:
    

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/install | sudo sh
```

> NOTE: If I'm nervous about running a foreign script, I can always download it and manually check its contents.

* I reboot the (base) system to load the Distrobox settings into memory.
    

## Uninstalling Distrobox.

* The following `Curl` command removes Distrobox:
    

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/uninstall | sudo sh
```

## Distrobox Environment Commands.

* I run the following to display a list of Distrobox commands:
    

```bash
distrobox
```

# The Results.

Distrobox presents a powerful solution for managing Linux distributions, offering seamless integration with my host system. By isolating container libraries, providing easy access to host hardware, and ensuring straightforward interactions with the host file system, it enhances the versatility of my software development environments. Whether for development, testing, or running different applications in isolated environments, Distrobox simplifies the process, making it accessible those who are new to container technology.
