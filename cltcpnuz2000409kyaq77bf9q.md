# TL;DR.

This post provides an overview of the various technologies I use in this blog. This list is *not* extensive, yet still emphasizes the importance of understanding, and applying, technological solutions. To excel in the continually-evolving development landscape, adapting to new tools needs to be an integral part of my daily routine.

# An Introduction.

This list evolves as I adopt new ways of solving problems. This list will also expand as new technologies are added to my toolkit.

> The purpose of this post is to centralise the descriptions of the techniques, and technologies, I employ in my workflows.

# The Big Picture.

I usually describe the technologies I use within the posts that I write. As a result, my tool descriptions are usually repeated throughout my blog. This is the result of trying to ensure each post is self-contained. (Sometimes, however, I may need to divide a topic across multiple posts.) Repetitive tool descriptions will happen when using the same tool on multiple projects. Therefore, having a repository of these descriptions makes creating new posts a little easier.

Below are descriptions of many technologies I use to build my solutions.

# What is Anaconda and Miniconda?

Python projects can run in virtual environments. These isolated spaces are used to manage project dependencies. Different versions of the same package can run in different environments specifically to avoid any conflicts between these versions.

venv is a built-in Python 3.3+ module that runs virtual environments. Anaconda is a Python and R distribution for scientific computing that includes the `conda` package manager. Miniconda is a small, free, bootstrap version of Anaconda that also includes the `conda` package manager, Python, and other packages that are required or useful (like pip and zlib).

# What is AnythingLLM?

AnythingLLM is a free, easy-to-use, and versatile document chatbot. It is made for people who want to chat with, or create, a custom knowledge base using existing documents and websites. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is the process of creating custom knowledge bases, which conveniently sidesteps the need for finetuning an LLM (Large Language Model) with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) or QLoRA (Quantised LoRA). The information from the documents and websites are converted, and saved, to a vector database so an LLM can use this data to improve its answers my queries. AnythingLLM can work with many users, or just a single user, from one installation. This makes AnythingLLM great for those who want a ChatGPT experience, and complete privacy, while supporting multiple users in the same setup.

# What is CUDA?

CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model created by NVIDIA. It has been downloaded over 20 million times and helps developers speed up their applications using GPU accelerators. CUDA is used in many fields, not just high-performance computing and research. For example, pharmaceutical companies use CUDA to find new treatments, cars use it to improve self-driving, and stores use it to analyse customer data for recommendations and ads.

Some people think CUDA, launched in 2006, is just a programming language or an API. But with over 150 CUDA-based libraries, SDKs, and tools, it's much more than that. NVIDIA keeps innovating, and thousands of GPU-accelerated applications use the NVIDIA CUDA platform. CUDAs flexibility and programmability make it the top choice for developing new deep learning and parallel computing algorithms.

CUDA also helps developers easily use the latest GPU features, like those in the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture.

# What is SSH?

The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is a way to safely send commands to a computer over an unsecured network. SSH uses special codes to check and protect connections between devices. It also allows for tunnelling, or port forwarding, which lets data packets go through networks they couldn't before. SSH is often used to control servers from a distance, manage infrastructure, and transfer files. It lets administrators manage servers and devices remotely. Older methods like Telnet sent commands that anyone could see. But SSH uses a secure connection, which is why it's called Secure Shell.

Twinny is designed to seamlessly work with locally-hosted LLMs (large language models), frameworks, and tools. It supports FIM (fill in the middle) code completion by providing real-time, AI-based suggestions that help as I type my code. I can also discuss my code with an LLM via the sidebar, where I can:

* Get explanations for how a function works,
    
* Ask the LLM to generate tests,
    
* Request code refactoring,
    
* and more.

# What is VS Code?

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a simple, yet powerful, code editor that works on my computer with versions for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It natively supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js. Other programming languages and technical abilities are available to VS Code through the use of appropriate Extensions.

# What are Web Page Scrapings?

Web page scraping, or data scraping, is the process of collecting content and data from websites, usually to save it for later use and analysis. Moving information from a website to a spreadsheet is a simple form of web scraping. But when I talk about 'web scrapers,' I'm referring to software 'bots' that automatically visit websites, find important data, and pull out useful information. Almost any data on a website can be scraped and is widely used in data analytics. Web scraping has a dark side and can be used to steal bank details or personal information. It is important to understand the risks, ethics, and legality of web scraping.

# What are Web URL Scrapings?

URLs (uniform resource locations) describe where specific assets (webpages, email services, downloads, etc.) are found. These are usually fed into the address bar of my browser either manually or via a link on a webpage. URL scraping is the process of finding all the URLs at a specified, domain-name address and then saving the results to a file or database.
